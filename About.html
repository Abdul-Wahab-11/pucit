                        <p>Located in the heart of Lahore, neighboring the buzzing Anarkali Bazar and the Mall Road,
                            PUCIT
                            is the largest institution of higher learning in Pakistan in Computer Science, Information
                            Technology, and Software Engineering. The College took a modest start with the Center for
                            Computer Science, established in the Center for Solid State Physics, Quaid-e-Azam (New)
                            Campus,
                            Lahore, in 1988. The first degree program offered by the Center was a one-year Post Graduate
                            Diploma (PGD) in Computer Science. 24 students were registered in this program during the
                            first
                            year. The Center was upgraded to Department of Computer Science in 1991. The Department
                            started
                            2-year (4-semesters) PGD leading to MSc in Computer Science under the annual system. In its
                            first batch, the 15 students were admitted to this program. The number doubled the following
                            year.

                            The Vice Chancellor, Lt Gen (R) Arshad Mahmood, further upgraded the Department to a
                            constituent
                            College in November 2000. The college was named Punjab University College of Information
                            Technology (PUCIT). The College launched the 4-year (8-semester) BSc (Honors) in Compute
                            Science
                            program in November 2000. The classes of the new BSc (Hons) in Computer Science started in
                            January 2001 with about 180 students. The program was offered on Self-Support basis only.
